## Beginners Visual Basic Tutorial


</div>

### Description

I wrote this 10 page tutorial because my brother wanted to learn visual basic. He decided not to read it any more after I wrote what I got done and so I never finished it. It is pretty good to start out beginners with programming. If it gets rated high enough I might continue writing it. Hope you all enjoy it and learn something.
